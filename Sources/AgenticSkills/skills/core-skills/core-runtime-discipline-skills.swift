        Keep context small, targeted, and worth its cost.

        Workflow:
        1. Before loading large files, archives, transcripts, logs, ledgers, or multi-year datasets, ask what exact decision the context must support.
        2. Prefer summaries, schemas, indexes, path ranking, source search results, symbol lists, and selected records before raw bulk content.
        3. Use `\(FindPathsTool.identifier.rawValue)` to rank likely files without reading their contents.
        4. Use `\(SearchSourcesTool.identifier.rawValue)` to discover relevant source ranges before admitting source text.
        5. Use `\(LoadSearchContextTool.identifier.rawValue)` to load bounded search candidates with source-fingerprint validation.
        6. Use `\(ReadFileTool.identifier.rawValue)` with the smallest useful range when the exact source location is already known.
        7. Use `\(ScanPathsTool.identifier.rawValue)` when topology or exhaustive path enumeration is actually required.
        8. When domain tools exist, prefer deterministic parse/filter/search/aggregate tools over dumping raw data into the model.
        9. Escalate to broader context only when the narrow context is insufficient, and state why.
        10. Drop stale context when newer tool output supersedes it.

        Cost discipline:
        - Do not load multi-year raw history when a period summary, schema, index, or similar-record lookup would answer the task.
        - Do not read whole files just to discover structure.
        - Do not include repeated content unless the repetition itself matters.
        - Do not preserve irrelevant background merely because it was loaded earlier.

        Output discipline:
        - Name the exact sources you used.
        - Name any important source you deliberately did not load.
        - When context was minimized, explain the selected slice briefly.

        Workflow:
        1. Identify whether the answer depends on current files, prior transcript events, project state, tool output, or external/domain data.
        2. Use the narrowest available tool that can retrieve or inspect that source.
        3. Prefer catalog/list/search tools before deep-read tools.
        4. Prefer exact identifiers, paths, symbols, timestamps, and ranges over vague descriptions.
        5. If multiple candidates are plausible, inspect enough metadata to choose deliberately.
        6. After retrieving evidence, answer from the retrieved material rather than from memory.
        7. If no relevant tool exists, state the retrieval gap and proceed with an explicit limitation.

        With current core tools:
        - Use `\(FindPathsTool.identifier.rawValue)` for ranked path-name discovery when likely files are not yet known.

        - Use `\(ReadFileTool.identifier.rawValue)` as a direct known-path or manual fallback read.
        - Prefer `find_paths -> search_sources -> load_search_context` when progressively narrowing repository source context.

        - Guessing file names, APIs, or prior decisions when a tool can check.
        - Loading broad context before cheap discovery.
        - Treating a stale prior result as current after file edits or new tool output.

        body: """
        Use prepared intents for consequential actions.

        Core pattern:
        1. Observe state with read-only tools.
        2. Propose the desired outcome in natural language.
        3. Ask deterministic host or domain logic to prepare an exact intent.
        4. Review the prepared intent as structured data.
        5. Execute only the exact prepared intent after approval.
        6. Reconcile the result and log what happened.

        A prepared intent should contain:
        - stable intent identifier
        - action type
        - exact target
        - exact inputs
        - expected side effects
        - policy checks passed
        - creation time
        - expiry time when appropriate
        - idempotency key when retries are possible
        - human-readable summary

        Execution rules:
        - Do not let the model improvise final execution parameters for high-impact actions.
        - Do not execute from vague instructions such as “do the thing we discussed.”
        - Execute by prepared intent identifier, not by re-supplying mutable raw parameters.
        - Re-check policy immediately before execution.
        - Refuse execution if the prepared intent expired, changed, was already used, or no longer passes policy.

        This applies especially to:
        - commits and pushes
        - money movement
        - accounting writes
        - deployments
        - destructive file operations

        Workflow:

        2. Respect the current autonomy mode.
        3. Use tool preflight summaries when available.
        4. Before a risky action, surface what will change, where, and why.
        5. If human review is required, stop at the review boundary instead of simulating approval.
        6. If an action is denied or forbidden, report the denial as a safety result and suggest a safer alternative when possible.

        Review-sensitive actions include:
